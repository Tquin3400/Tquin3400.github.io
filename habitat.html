      You need to arrest her, officer. I mean this Goldilocks person, she walked
      right into our house like it was hers. She ate the porridge that Mama Bear
      made for us. She was soooooo hungry. She could have just eaten one bowl
      but noooo she had to find the perfect one so she ate them all. And she did
      not even bring the dishes to the sink! Then she went to take a nap in our
      beds she messed all three of them up. Sat in all the chairs and broke one,
      and did not clean up. Who does this sort of thing?! I think she should
      have to pay a big fine. Actually, she probably does not care about what
      she did. Fining her is not enough, I want her in jail so she can think
      about her behavior! Yes, ARREST GOLDILOCKS! ARREST HER!
